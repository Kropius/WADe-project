            <p> &emsp; &emsp;
                The application Rest Api Interactive Tool(known as RAT) is a web tool that uses natural language
                constructs to interact with different REST APIs, specifically their OpenApi
                documentation. Based on this, a human-like(text based/voice) interaction with the given APIs will be
                possible. The end user will have the possibility to select an API, from a predefined list, or upload one.
                He will be able to interact in a natural manner with the API using the web interface
                of the application.
            <p>
                &emsp; &emsp; The application will be able to determine valid routes, with valid request bodies or even
                query
                parameters based on the user input according to the selected RestApi.
            </p>

                The above diagram displays the possible ways the user can interact with the application:
            <ul>
                <li><em>Uploads a valid OpenApi documentation:</em> The user can upload an OpenApi documentation</li>
                <li><em>Choose an available API: </em> The user will select a certain API from the given list, and the
                    application will make the future translation based on the selected API </li>
                <li><em>Types a request: </em> The user can type anything he wants and the application will try to map
                    his <em>request</em> to a valid route with a valid body </li>
                <li><em>Uses speech recognition in order to send the request: </em> The user speak aloud his request and
                    the application will parse his <em>request</em> in order to return a valid route with a valid body

            </ul>

            <h3>4.1 Speech recognition</h3>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp;
                The presented application needs to have speech recognition capabilities, meaning that user will be able
                to use his voice in order to <em>type</em> his request.

                Having this in mind we have the following ways to parse the user's speech input.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <em>Client side parsing</em>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            meaning that an external library will be used at the client level, or
                            even a native functionality that most browsers have(or should have) in order to convert the
                            speech to text;
                        </li>
                        <li> after this the resulted text will be displayed so that the user will acknowledge what the
                              request will actually look like</li>
                        <li> this approach is more user friendly because of the fact the user always be able to see how his
                             speech was parsed</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>

                    <em>Server side parsing</em>:
                    <ul>
                        <li>meaning that the user's speech input will be parsed at the server level using one of the many tools Google Cloud has</li>
                        <li>anytime the user tries to use the speech input, his input will be sent to the server and the server will turn it into a text</li>
                        <li>
                            now that the server has the speech input from the user as a text, the text can be parsed just like a normal typed input
                        </li>
                        <li> after this the server will return back to the user the path and the body according to his initial request </li>
                        <li>this approach can have better results, due to the fact the Google Cloud tools for speech recognition are very accurate</li>
                        <li>however the user will not be able to see how his speech was converted to text</li>
                        <li>a solution for the above drawback is to return to the user, the text resulted from his speech translation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

                    <li>
                        <b>/apis</b> [POST]: creates a new Api entry in the database

                    <li>
                        <b>/apis/{id}</b> [GET]: returns all data about the api with the given <em>id</em>

                    <li>
                        <b>/apis/specifications</b> [GET]: lists all stored api specifications
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <b>/apis/:id/nlp-to-rest </b> [POST]: Translate a command given in natural language into a valid REST request
                    </li>

            <h2>6. Front-end</h2>
            <p> &emsp; &emsp; The use will interact with a single-page application(SPA), built with React, CSS and
                obviously JSX. </p>
            <figure typeOf="sa:image" class="img-containter">

            </figure>
            <p>&emsp; &emsp; However the above design will not be completely replicated. Our purpose and goal is to use
                the library <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@awsui/components-react">AWSUI</a>, built obviously
                by Amazon. This library is also used in AWS console, and provides a collection of reusable and
                responsive React components.</p>
